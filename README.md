Twiiter auto comments with multiple accounts
Twitter auto comment using python

Here, I have added up to 3 accounts which will auto-login and auto-comment to the post. If you need more accounts, copy lines from 106 to 150 and paste them in line 151. Don't forget to change the username and password.

Change the username and password in lines 16 and 20, and where the username and password are asked in the code below.

Also, change the URL in line 23 and do the same in the code below where the URL is needed.

(Note: For auto-login, the accounts used must be non-authentication accounts.)

Download the latest version of the Chrome Driver from https://chromedriver.chromium.org/ and extract the file. Place it in the folder, open CMD in that particular folder, and enter cmt.py, or double-click on the cmt.py file.

(In this video, I have bot auto-commenting for only one account. You can use this code to run multiple accounts for auto-commenting.)
