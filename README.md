Twiiter auto comments with multiple accounts using selenium with python

Here, I have added up to 2 accounts which will auto-login and auto-comment to the post. 

# Change the random words if you want different words in the 15th line, the username and password of Twitter in the 24th and 28th lines, the Twitter post URL in the 31st line, and replace the '5' with how many comments you want in the 51st line.

# do same replacement in second acc where it's aksed..

# Note: For auto-login, the accounts used must be non-authentication accounts

Download the latest version of the Chrome Driver from https://chromedriver.chromium.org/ and extract the file. Place it in the folder, open CMD in that particular folder, and enter cmt.py, or double-click on the cmt.py file.

(In this video, I have bot auto-commenting for only one account. You can use the code to run multiple accounts for auto-commenting.)

ðŸ‘‰Note:-

ðŸ‘‰if your selenium version is in latest version then 
the code never run 

ðŸ‘‰open cmd and enter pip uninstall selenium

And enter 

pip install selenium==4.2.1
or
pip install selenium==4.2.0

and hit enter 

and 

python -c "import selenium; print(selenium.__version__)"
<to check the current version of selenium>
